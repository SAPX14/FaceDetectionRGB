# FaceDetectionRGB
This is a YT guided project regarding my attempt to learn openCV using Arduino . Project involves use of RGB led which turns red as soon as face becomes undetectable.
# OutputModule_LED
In this part i learnt how to control arduino led using python code. cv2 , serialModule packages were used .Then used cv2 module to display graphics ,where the window displays two diff images of led on and off in sync with the actual led being on and off.
# InputModule_Potentiometer
Here i learnt how to read potentiometer values using python code .Again here i learnt to use cv2 graphics to make a circlular bar fill up wrt input provided by potentiometer knob.
# FinalProjectLayout_RGB
In this final project I learnt how to control RGB module using python .Then I learnt to use FaceDetection module in cv2 .So untill a face is detected by cam the led is green ,as soon as the face is undectable the led turns red.
